        IIT-KGP is the 1st IIT and has the largest campus area among all the IITs. The appeal of vast expanses
        of green, sweeping trees everywhere and the classic architecture blends in with the creative lifestyle
        of young KGPians. Full residential campus away from the hustle-bustle of city life accelerates the
        student life towards social and creative gatherings and develops among them the extra-ordinary skill in
        all the spheres.

        IIT-KGP campus plays a major role in students’ academic and social life, making the KGP stay most
        memorable days of their life and making them ready to shine in the World — what we call as KGPians.
        One key element of this campus experience is one's 'Hall of Residence'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The institute is fully residential. Students are accommodated in 21 Halls of Residence and the staff is
        provided with quarters. Accommodation for visitors is arranged in the Technology Guest House, CEC Guest
        House, Alumni Guest House or CTS Visitors Hall, or if need arises, in students' Hall of Residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        It won't be an exageration to say that the Hall is one of the key anchors of Student Life at IIT-KGP.
        Halls at Kharagpur are places to live, nurture, grow and excel. We dedicate this application towards
        the unique 'Hall Culture' of IIT Kharagpur.
